# Overview

Modern application development—especially for cloud-native, containerized, and hybrid cloud environments—benefits significantly from following the [12-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology. Originally designed for building software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, the 12-Factor approach has become a foundational set of best practices for creating scalable, maintainable, and portable applications that thrive in dynamic infrastructure environments.

## What Are the 12 Factors?

The 12 factors are a set of guidelines that address key aspects of application design and deployment, including:

1. **Codebase** – One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
2. **Dependencies** – Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
3. **Config** – Store configuration in the environment
4. **Backing Services** – Treat backing services as attached resources
5. **Build, Release, Run** – Strictly separate build and run stages
6. **Processes** – Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
7. **Port Binding** – Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency** – Scale out via the process model
9. **Disposability** – Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/Prod Parity** – Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
11. **Logs** – Treat logs as event streams
12. **Admin Processes** – Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

By adhering to these principles, developers can ensure their applications are resilient, easy to configure, and ready for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). The 12-Factor methodology encourages statelessness, environment-agnostic configuration, and seamless integration with cloud-native platforms such as Kubernetes and OpenShift.

## Why 12-Factor Matters for Cloud-Native and Containers

- **Portability:** 12-Factor apps can be deployed on any cloud or container platform with minimal changes.
- **Scalability:** Statelessness and process-based concurrency make it easy to scale horizontally.
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns and configuration management simplifies updates and troubleshooting.
- **DevOps Alignment:** The methodology aligns with modern DevOps practices, enabling rapid iteration and reliable deployments.
