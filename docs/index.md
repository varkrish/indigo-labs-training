## Mission

**Empowering teams to build cutting-edge software through agile development practices and cloud-native technologies.**

This comprehensive guide brings together the essential practices, tools, and methodologies needed to deliver high-quality software in today's fast-paced development landscape. We focus on leveraging **containerization**, **agile workflows**, and **open-source technologies** to enable rapid iteration, reliable deployments, and scalable architectures.

## What You'll Learn

- **Agile development practices** that accelerate delivery and improve collaboration
- **Containerization with Podman** for consistent, reproducible development and deployment environments
- **Cloud-native architectures** that leverage microservices, 12-factor principles, and modern design patterns
- **Test-driven development** and continuous integration/deployment workflows
- **Enterprise-grade solutions** using Red Hat UBI (Universal Base Images) and ecosystem tools

Our approach emphasizes **practical application** with real-world examples using **.NET and React Native**, all containerized with **Podman and podman compose**.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Cloud Fundamentals
Master cloud-native concepts, hybrid cloud strategies, and the CNCF landscapeâ€”the foundation for building modern, scalable applications.

### 2. Containerization
Learn container fundamentals with Podman, CRI-O container engines, and orchestration with Kubernetes/OpenShift to create portable, consistent environments.

### 3. Development Foundations
Adopt proven practices: requirement-centric development, 12-factor app methodology, microservices architecture, clean architecture, and optimized inner-loop workflows.

### 4. Agile Development & Testing
Implement BDD/TDD practices, local development with podman compose, API mocking strategies, and performance testing in containerized environments.

### 5. Red Hat Ecosystem
Leverage Red Hat Software Collections and UBI images for secure, enterprise-grade container development with supply chain integrity.

## Getting Started

**New to cloud-native development?** Start with **Cloud Fundamentals** to understand the paradigm shift.

**Ready to containerize?** Jump to **Containerization** to master Podman and container workflows.

**Building applications?** Explore **Development Foundations** for architectural patterns and agile methodologies.

**Focused on quality?** Dive into **Agile Development & Testing** for BDD/TDD and testing strategies.

**Deploying to production?** Leverage the **Red Hat Ecosystem** for secure, enterprise-grade container images.

## Why This Approach?

**Speed & Agility**: Containerization and agile practices reduce friction between development, testing, and production, enabling faster iteration cycles.

**Consistency**: Podman and UBI images ensure your development environment matches production, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.

**Quality & Reliability**: Test-driven development, clean architecture, and continuous integration practices catch issues early and maintain code quality.

**Security & Compliance**: Red Hat UBI images provide enterprise-grade security, supply chain transparency, and long-term support.

**Open Source**: All tools and technologies are built on open-source foundations, giving you flexibility and community support.

## How to Use This Guide
